# RIVET



Program to visualize multi-dimensional persistence.

created December 2013

## Building

After cloning to $RIVET_DIR:


    cd $RIVET_DIR
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd .. 
    qmake  #make sure this is qmake from Qt 5, not Qt 4!
    make
    

After this, you will have two executables built: the viewer (RIVET.app, 
on a Mac, RIVET elsewhere), and the computation engine (rivet_console).
It is then necessary to move or symlink the console into the same folder
where the viewer was built. For example, on Mac OS X:

    cd RIVET.app/Contents/MacOS
    ln -s ../../../build/rivet_console
    
In the future, all these steps will be automated so that a single cmake
build will create both executables, and put everything in the right place.
